## üìå Project Requirements

- [x] You should have an input element with an id="text-input"
- [x] You should have a button element with an id="check-btn"
- [x] You should have a div, span, or p element with an id="result"
- [x] When clicking on the #check-btn without input, an alert should appear with the text "Please input a value"
- [x] The app should correctly detect whether the input is a palindrome or not
- [x] The text input should accept phrases, letters, numbers, and ignore punctuation or spaces
- [x] Display the corresponding result inside the #result element

## ‚úÖ Project Tests (User Stories)

1. You should have an input element with id="text-input"
2. You should have a button element with id="check-btn"
3. You should have a div, span, or p element with id="result"
4. Clicking the button without input triggers an alert
5. Entering single letters like "A" must detect a palindrome
6. Complex phrases with spaces, punctuation, and capitalization are correctly detected
7. Non-palindrome entries are correctly flagged
8. All user stories should be passed
9. The result text updates immediately without any fade animation

## üñºÔ∏è Project Context

This is one of the required projects to earn the **Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures** from freeCodeCamp.  
Through this challenge, I learned how to:

-  Build functional apps using plain JavaScript
-  Manipulate and validate strings
-  Create clean user feedback mechanisms
-  Develop projects without relying on external libraries
-  Blend minimalist design with responsive functionality
